This app, made for a Lambda School assignment, uses the Kanye Rest API to pull in random quotes from Kanye West, matches them with one of a handful of Kanye photos from around the web, and displays them in a Semantic UI card, refreshing on button click.

Technologies used:
* React
* Redux
* Axios
* Vercel
* Semantic UI
